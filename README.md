# stupid-hackathon-teensy

5 hours project from the (Stupid Hackathon 3.0)[http://www.stupidhackathon.com] 2016 at ITP, New York. I wrote an alternative program to run on the (Deceit Board)[https://github.com/leoneckert/deceit-board]. The program will make anyone build a website, no matter what keys a pressen on the keyboard (external keyboard attached to the computer intercepted by Deceit Board). Every key oressed results in a preprogrammed key that reaches the computer. Key by key the user first opens the terminal, creates a directory on the Desktop, downloads some files, opens textEdit, wirtes html code, goes back to the terminal and opens the website he build, which will look like (this)[http://leoneckert.com/stupid/stupid_thing.html]. Video of someone typing will follow.
