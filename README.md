# stupid-hackathon-teensy

5-hour project from the [Stupid Hackathon 3.0](http://www.stupidhackathon.com) 2016 at ITP, New York. I wrote an alternative program to run on the [Deceit Board](https://github.com/leoneckert/deceit-board). The program will make anyone build a website, no matter what keys a pressed on the keyboard (external keyboard attached to the computer intercepted by Deceit Board). Every key pressed results in a preprogrammed key that reaches the computer. Key by key the user first opens the terminal, creates a directory on the Desktop, downloads some files, opens textEdit, writes html code, goes back to the terminal and opens the website he built, which will look like [this](http://leoneckert.com/stupid/stupid_thing.html). Video of someone typing up here soon. 
Typing so fast and producing perfectly clean code at the same time feels rewarding. Like a super hacker. Can also be used in film production.
